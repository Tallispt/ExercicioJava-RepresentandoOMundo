## Java exercice 

This is an exercise from a Java acceleration bootcamp offered by Driven Education. The goal is to use object-oriented programming (OOP) to build a simple Java application with methods, properties, and intertwined classes that simulate a platform for educational purposes.



## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
